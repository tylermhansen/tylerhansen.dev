### This is the code for my personal website.

I started with a theme from Nordic Giant, which can be found [here](https://github.com/nordicgiant2/react-nice-resume).
This project uses the react particle background component library [https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg).
